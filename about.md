I analyze and visualize data. More generally, I am curious about how things work, exploring information, ideas, and places, and sharing the experience of discovery with others. 

I studied math at Williams College, directed the outdoors program at Double H camp, taught high school juniors at Chewonki Semester School in Maine, raced through the forests of Sweden orienteering, analyzed data and forecasted revenue at Google, developed a new charting style to visualize Simpson's paradox, and am now studying at the School for Poetic Computation.

[Visualizing Simpson's Paradox and Mix Effects](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub42901.html)

This work will presented at InfoVis 2014 in Paris in November and published in the Proceedings of IEEE InfoVis 2014, IEEE. It's the result of my collaboration with Google's Data Visualization research group led by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi√©gas.
