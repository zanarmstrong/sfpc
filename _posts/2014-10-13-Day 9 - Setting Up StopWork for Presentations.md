title: Day 9 - Setting Up StopWork for Presentations
---

Ramsey has built a nice, simple program for HTML presentations. It's based on Markdown, and embeds websites, videos, images, or shows text simply.  

I wanted to use it to create a slideshow of the websites we're referencing during the semester. So, I followed his instructions in [his github repository](https://github.com/nasser/stopwork) to clone the code. I also had to install rails since I didn't already have it, and an extra package called "thin" as well as the packages mustache and kramdown which he mentions. 

Note that there is an export option if you want to share it as a html file with js, rather than simply run/present locally. 

A draft of the slideshow is [here](bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/raw/f9bb3f69a1faefa21ada).
