title: Warm Fuzzies on a Windy Day
---

Had a pretty amazing day watching the marathon, cheering for a good friend from childhood in her last marathon race, and enjoying a run myself and the largest donut I've ever had. On the way home, I found myself wandering into a very welcoming community at a music-playing, god-praising, community-making Presbyterian Church when I opened the door to see where the music was coming from.  

The New York Marathon is unlike others I've seen, as there were so many people lining the streets the whole way and the people running were so friendly.  Seemed like a 26.2 mile street party.
