On Monday Ramsey asked us to go to [Great Art Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/greatartbot), choose an image, and describe in text how you might recreate it.  

I liked this image because I thought it looked like rain.

Having a little fun, I wrote [an example in D3](http://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/raw/73ce430053eabd1b70fe) to create images in the same style. Each time you refresh or click on the text you can get a new image.
