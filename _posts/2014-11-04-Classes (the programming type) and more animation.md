title: Classes (the programming type) and more animation
---

I updated the animation from yesterday so that if I clicked I could add a new set of spinning triangles.  To do this I created a spiralObject class, created a vector for the multiple spiralObjects, and added spiralObjects to the vector on mouse click.  

[Here](https://vimeo.com/110936580) is the result.  I like how it slips into seeming chaos and then clear patterns form again.
