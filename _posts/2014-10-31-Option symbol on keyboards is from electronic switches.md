title: Option symbol on keyboards is from electronic switches
---

Found out today that the "option" symbol ‚å• is a symbol for an electronic switch, specifically a "changeover switch" or "single pole, double throw." In other words, a "2-way changeover switch directs the flow of current to one of two routes according to its position." And, this makes perfect sense to mean "option."

Worlds colliding.  Amazing.
