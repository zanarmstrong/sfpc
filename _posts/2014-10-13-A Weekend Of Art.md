title: A Weekend Of Art
---

This weekend I visited the [Robotic Church](http://amorphicrobotworks.org/works/theroboticchurch/index.htm), [Brooklyn Museum](http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/home.php), and [Pioneer Works](http://pioneerworks.org/) during their Open Studio event.

The Robotic Church was quite fantastic. Over 40 robots are animated during a 45 minute show that includes music and movement. The technology is based on pneumatics and each show is different. It was amazing how much personality the robots seemed to have based on their shape and actions. The space itself, the former Norwegian Seaman's Church is also a beautiful space. If you do swing by Redhook, the bakery Baked is also quite tasty and has yummy hot chocolate which is perfect on a crisp fall day.

Pioneer Works is a beautiful creative space that is also in Redhook. During their open studios, I enjoyed exploring and taking lots of photographs of the space and some of the art as well.

At the Brooklyn Museum, I was most excited about the crossing Brooklyn project but ended up especially enjoying the Egypt exhibit. There was also a fun exhibit on the history of the high heeled shoe.
