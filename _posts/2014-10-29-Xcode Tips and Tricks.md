title: Xcode Tips & Tricks
---

I'm just getting started with Xcode and Open Frameworks (OF). I asked Zach for some tips & tricks for debugging, figuring out what's going on, and generally navigating xcode in useful ways. These include: 

- **use "endl" with comments** to separate out each time it runs in the console output
- **breakpoint** for debugging and seeing what's currently defined
- **code completion** to see what methods an object has
- **right click to 'jump to definition'**
- add **TODO** notes for yourself in the code, and you can find them in the navigator at the top
- **use the navigator** to see what functions exist in that file
- "ctrl, command, up" for switching between header and cpp file
