title: Three ways to do something
---

I am very excited to start learning Open Frameworks!

I like the idea of using drawings and images as a form of input. I decided to play around with using another photo to color a line drawing. 

Once I had it working, I showed it to Zach and he offered two others ways I could do it. My original approach was quite brute force. I used the lightness/darkness of a pixel on the line drawing to decide if I should make a 1 pixel by 1 pixel rectangle grey if the original was near-white or colored if the original was near-black (part of a line). If colored, I would then get the color to use from a pixel on another photograph. The second approach was to create a new image instead of creating hundreds or thousands of rectangles, one for each pixel. The last approach was even more fun: to use shaders to define the final image. 

I really liked this way of learning. It was good to attempt a brute force approach, followed up by actually coding up 2 different alternatives. It creates more depth in terms of understanding the space of possibilities. 

Lots of fun to play with!
