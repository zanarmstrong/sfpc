title: Jittery Line
---

Inspired by Zach's talk on animation, I created [a fun little "jittery line" website in D3/Javascript](http://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/raw/d189ee30a7fb01ca6850/).

Best sign that it's fun is when friends start sending images & gifs that they made :). Thanks Robbie & Paul! 

"Cool"
