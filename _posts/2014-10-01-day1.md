title: School for Poetic Computation, Day 1
---

October 1st is day 1 of [SFPC](sfpc.io). I'll be spending the next 10 weeks in the Lower East Side of Manhattan to learn and create with 15 other amazing students and a number of teachers.

Activities on day 1 included some introductions, writing down as many questions as possible about the next 10 weeks, examples of work that Zach considers poetic computation, and a game of "human fax machine."  

##### The Poetry in Poetic Computation
The school's name was chosen quite thoughtfully. One reason is because poetry "celebrates small explorations." For example, Laura Belém's installation ["Enamorados"](http://laurabelem.com.br/Enamorados-Enamored) at the 2005 Venice Biennial consisted of two boats with lights facing each other and sending signals via the lights such that it looked like they were in conversation. It was subtle, simple, and beautiful. The other works mentioned are [here](https://sfpc.hackpad.com/What-is-poetic-computation-Ntejnmctkmf).

##### Themes to play with
While going through the works, Zach mentioned a few themes that artists play with in different works. For example, some works play with "transmission: encoding and decoding" while others explore "what-if questions." "Re-ordering" was another one. It'll be interesting to add to this list as the semester goes on, and use it for inspiration.

##### "Human Fax Machine"
My favorite part of the day was the "Human Fax Machine". Our group of 4 people had to figure out a code we could use to describe how to draw a line drawing. One group would start with a drawing and could make sounds, but not speak or gesture, to communicate to the other team. The other two would then have to interpret the sounds and draw a picture, hopefully the same image that the first group started with.
