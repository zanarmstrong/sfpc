Just a few of the things from the last few days...

The team getting ready for the Silent Barn event with kids gave me a chance to make a rainbox with LED lightning in the clouds. The lights blink different colors.Super fun!

Meanwhile, over in Open Framewors, I figured out how to count the connected white components in an image, like the one of the left, and color each component a different color, as shown on the right.  Code is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/umt667t68el1gb0/connectedComponents.zip?dl=0).
