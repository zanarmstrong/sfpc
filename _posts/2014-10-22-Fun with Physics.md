title: Fun with Physics

In talking about animation, Zach introduced some work by Masahiko Sato that reveals the physics and math in everyday experiences. 

Still from the video showing the path of the tail end of a thrown mallet:

The full video is [here](http://visiblevisible.org/deliver/parsons2010/CURVES_DVD.m4v). Note that it's quite large and will be slow to load.

The same artist has another fun project in collaboration with Tatsuya Saito to show how paper itself is or can be quite immersive. [Illustrations You Can Touch](http://www.spoon-tamago.com/2014/04/10/illustrations-that-you-can-touch-by-masahiko-sato-and-tatsuya-saito/) are beautiful illustrations that are designed to have a place where you should put your fingers. When you do, the meaning of the illustration changes, such that it seems that you are a part of what's happening or that it's reacting to your fingers. 

I'm also interested to explore video tracking software, in which you can draw lines showing the motion of objects in a video.
