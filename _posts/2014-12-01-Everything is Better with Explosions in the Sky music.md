title: Everything is Better with Explosions in the Sky music
---

Today I watched [a great video of Amanda Cox's keynote at OpenVis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha9LA3rYD9g#t=441) a few years ago.  In it she said jokingly that everything looks good with "Explosions in the Sky" music playing in the background, even black and white boxes. :) 

I was feeling playful, and thought it would be fun to [test this theory](http://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/raw/00aeeb7079ff8a936d07/). It's totally true! Code [here](http://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/00aeeb7079ff8a936d07).
