title: Synthesizing Images
---

It's been two weeks since I've posted. Opps! Last week I was in Paris for InfoVis, including presenting my research on [Visualizing Statistical Mix Effects and Simpson's Paradox](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub42901.html). But, more on that later. For now, just want to dive back into class, Open Frameworks, and this week's topic of synthesizing images.
