title: Slinkies and Amplification
---

A friend at school attached a slinky to a box today for part of a project. The best part was that the box worked as a surprisingly good amplifier. It was fun to see how fundamentally simple amplification actually is... and to enjoy the great sounds a slinky can make. Evidently it's pretty similar to how they created [the Star Wars blasters sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTbtHVFyKoQ&feature=youtu.be&t=1m41s)!
