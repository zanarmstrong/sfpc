### Nathan & sound
Really amazing conversation with Nathan about sound. 

* Sound is composed of many sounds, many waves. Even strumming a taught string has multiple overlapping sounds: the sound of your thumb against the string, the resulting “fundamental” resonance, the associated “harmonics” since the string is also vibrating at shorter distances, and the fact that not all these harmonics are multiples of 1/2. 

* Describing the difference between the sound of a bike crashing and hands rubbing - and translating that to differences in the sound waves. The sound waves have amplitude, frequency, and a sense of time/duration. Does it start fast (like a crash) or slower? Does it sustain? How many sounds make up what you hear? 

* Relationship between sound and vibration… very low sounds that you can feel in your chest resonating as much as you can hear with your ears.

* Sounds has an “envelope” including “attack”, “sustain”, “decay”, and “release.” 

* All sound is air moving.  Really.  

* As you lengthen the frequency, you get below the window we can hear… and at longer and longer frequencies eventually what you’re talking about is weather

* Fourier: any waveform, every very complex, can be described as the sum of sin waves. This is sound. Synthesizers use this. 

* Very cool to look at the wave as you hear the sound. For me, this makes it easier to hear the sound and notice what I’m hearing. Interesting to see that you can graph with time on the x axis and ?amplitude? on the y… or with frequency on the x axis and ? on the y. 

* It is so amazing that we can hear and make any sense of what we hear. 

It was especially wonderful to see how he used the soundscape and objects around us to make his points. For example, contrasting the bike falling to a sound he could make with his hands, or finding a string he could tie to the table leg and strum.
