title: Day 2 - Binary Numbers
---

Highlights of Day 2 included: 
...saving an image from Photoshop in raw format and opening it in Audacity as sound

...a cool example turning a gray scale images stored with 8 bits per pixel into 8 black and white images where each pixel is encoded by just 1 of the original bits

...creating games or activities to teach binary numbers
