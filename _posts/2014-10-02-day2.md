title: Day 2 - Binary Numbers
---

Highlights of Day 2 included: 
1. Saving an image from Photoshop in raw format and opening it in Audacity as sound

2. Transforming a gray scale images stored with 8 bits per pixel into 8 black and white images where each pixel is encoded by just 1 of the original bits

3. Creating games or activities to teach binary numbers

I also thought that John Simon's ["Every Icon"](http://numeral.com/appletsoftware/eicon.html) project was kind of fun.  I created a [D3 version[(http://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/raw/0500075f337ab2ac3013/) that's 8x8 instead of 32x32, so it actually moves through the icons a little faster.  Even after 17 years, the original is just barely on the second row.
