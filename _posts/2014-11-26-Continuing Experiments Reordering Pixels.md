Continuing from where I left off in the [Reordering Pixels post](http://sfpc.zanarmstrong.com/Reordering%20Pixels/), I've now added color!  

Code is [here](https://github.com/zanarmstrong/open-frameworks-sketches/tree/master/reorderPixels/reorderPixelsCameraColored) before I sorted by color and [here](https://github.com/zanarmstrong/open-frameworks-sketches/tree/master/reorderPixels/ArrayStructure) with sort by Brightness.  With a small change, I can sort by Hue instead. I'm also experimenting with vectors and arrays to see which is faster, and trying to see if having a separate color object with getHue/getBrightness functions might help. But, I think that might just be repeating what the ofColor object already does. 

Also, now it's responding to input from the computer's camera instead of uploading still images. 

With color, but in the corner and without sorting the colors.

With color, and centered.

With color, sorting by brightness.
