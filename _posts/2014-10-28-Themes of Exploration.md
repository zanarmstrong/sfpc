Fascinating morning with Zach today. On the first day, Zach told us that if we came away from the 10 weeks with really good questions, then it was a success. 

In that vein, the inspiring questions today for creating generative visuals are: 

* What visual aspects can you play with? Position? Size? Color? Boundary of another object? And many more... 

* What are your seeds? Variables? A drawing? Movement? Time? A photograph? Sounds? ??? 

And, in a slightly different vein, how can you play with the edge of what we can perceive as some (an image, etc) vs abstract?
